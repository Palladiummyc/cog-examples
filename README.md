# Cog example models

You'll need to [install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) to get model weights.

You wouldn't do this normally. You would run Cog at the end of your training process, when the weights are on disk somewhere, then Cog would store your model weights. But to demonstrate how Cog works, we need to give you some pre-trained weights.
